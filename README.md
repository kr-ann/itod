This repository contains a realisation of an algorithm for performing Word Sense Disambiguation.
Original datasets we use are in the folder 'data', 
the folder 'preprocessed' contains outputs of the notebook 'Preparing datasets', and 
results of different steps from the notebook "WSI to WSD" are included in the folder 'results'.

Comments about the algorithm can be found in the notebooks themselves, and a fuller description will be here soon!
