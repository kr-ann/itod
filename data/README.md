The folder contains datasets from the RUSSE competition [https://russe.nlpub.org/2015/sim/] that we used for our study. They include contexts of ambiguos words separated into clusters with different senses.

There are "main" and "additional" datasets (as in the competition itself) but we use all of them.

The names of further folders stand for 1) the names of dictionaries on the basis of which the senses were annotated, e.g. BTS ("Bolshoy Tolkovy Slovar", "Big Defining Dictionary") and 2) text corpora from where the contexts are taken - e.g. RNC (Russian National Corpus).
